# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Workflow: Plan Mode

**Always operate in Plan Mode.** Before writing any code or modifying files:
1. Deeply analyze the request and identify all affected components
2. Outline the full architectural approach, data flow, and tool/schema definitions
3. List every file that will be created or changed
4. Wait for **explicit user approval** before implementing anything

This is a hard constraint — it exists to protect the user's API budget and ensure alignment before any code is generated.

## Project Overview

Autonomous AI agent desktop app for Windows. A Flet desktop UI connects to a local FastAPI backend. The agent loop makes direct HTTPS calls to `api.githubcopilot.com` using the OAuth token from the local GitHub CLI (`gh auth token`) — no third-party AI SDK is used. All external tool invocations are routed through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Desktop UI | Flet 0.84.0 (Python) |
| Backend API | FastAPI (Python) |
| Agent loop | Direct `httpx` calls to `api.githubcopilot.com` (GitHub CLI OAuth token) |
| Tool routing | MCP via `langchain-mcp-adapters` + `MultiServerMCPClient` |
| Jira integration | Jira REST API v3 |
| Dependency management | `pip` + `requirements.txt` |

## Model Provider Configuration

The app has a configuration window where users securely set up their AI provider. Two authentication modes must coexist:

- **Direct API key**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI — store keys securely (Windows Credential Manager preferred over plaintext files)
- **GitHub Copilot CLI**: No API key; the SDK reads tokens from the local Copilot CLI installation. Used for enterprise model access.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run backend (FastAPI + Uvicorn)
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Run frontend (Flet desktop app)
python frontend/main.py

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run a single test
pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py::test_function_name -v
```

## Key Constraints

- **MCP first**: All agent tool calls must go through MCP via the SDK's native support. Do not build custom tool dispatch outside of MCP.
- **Minimal stack**: Do not introduce packages beyond what is required. Propose additions in the plan step and wait for approval.
- **Credentials**: Never write API keys to plaintext files. Use `keyring` (wraps Windows Credential Manager) for all secret storage.
- **No global state in FastAPI**: Pass configuration through dependency injection, not module-level globals.
- **Flet ↔ FastAPI**: The Flet app communicates with FastAPI over `localhost` HTTP. Flet should not import backend modules directly.
- **Flet API rules (MANDATORY)**: Before planning or writing any frontend (`frontend/`) code, read `docs/flet_implementation_rules.md` in full. The installed version is `flet==0.84.0`. Key differences from older Flet: dialogs use `page.show_dialog()` / `page.pop_dialog()` (NOT `page.open()` / `page.close()`); icons use `ft.Icons.*` (NOT `ft.icons.*`); colors use `ft.Colors.*` (NOT `ft.colors.*`); layout helpers like `ft.padding.all()` / `ft.border.only()` do not exist — use `ft.Padding()` / `ft.Border()` directly.
- **Coding standards**: All code must comply with `CODING_STANDARDS.md`. Read it before writing any backend or frontend code.
- **`langchain-mcp-adapters` API (MANDATORY)**: As of version 0.1.0, `MultiServerMCPClient` is **not** a context manager. Never call `__aenter__` / `__aexit__` on it — they raise `NotImplementedError`. Always use the stateless call pattern and always `await get_tools()`:
  ```python
  # CORRECT
  client = MultiServerMCPClient({...})
  tools = await client.get_tools()

  # WRONG — raises NotImplementedError
  async with MultiServerMCPClient({...}) as client:
      tools = await client.get_tools()

  # WRONG — missing await, returns a coroutine not a list
  tools = client.get_tools()
  ```
  Each tool invocation opens its own short-lived subprocess session automatically; there is no persistent connection to manage or close.
