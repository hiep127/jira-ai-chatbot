# Feature Plan: UI Polish & Architecture Documentation

**Status:** Implemented
**Source:** `req.md` — three parts
**Laws observed:** ARCHITECTURE.md (Strict Layered Architecture, Context Budgeting, Actionable Observability, Mathematical Precision, Security), CLAUDE.md (Plan Mode, MCP-first, no global state, keyring)

## Files to Create or Modify

| # | Action | Path |
|---|--------|------|
| 1 | Modify | `frontend/main.py` |
| 2 | Modify | `ARCHITECTURE.md` *(append new section — do NOT replace existing engineering laws)* |
| 3 | Modify | `frontend/views/jira_settings.py` *(UX polish: label shortening, field reordering, validation expansion, SnackBar → `show_error_dialog` — see Part 4)* |
| 4 | Modify | `backend/main.py` *(add `/compact` POST route with `CompactRequest`/`CompactResponse` Pydantic models and LangGraph state-mutation logic)* |

No new packages required.

## Critical Conflict: `ARCHITECTURE.md` Already Exists

`ARCHITECTURE.md` at the project root currently contains the **5 Engineering Laws** that the jira-planner skill reads as its constraint document. Overwriting it would destroy those rules.

**Resolution:** Append a new `## Project Structure` section to the existing file rather than replacing it. All existing law content is preserved verbatim.

## Part 1 — Move "Compact" Button to Input Row

**File:** `frontend/main.py`

### Change 1a — Remove `compact_btn` from the header `ft.Row`

**Location:** Line 255

Current:
```
ft.Row([title_text, summary_btn, compact_btn, settings_btn], alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.SPACE_BETWEEN),
```

New:
```
ft.Row([title_text, summary_btn, settings_btn], alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.SPACE_BETWEEN),
```

### Change 1b — Inject `compact_btn` into the input `ft.Row`

**Location:** Line 257

Current:
```
ft.Row([input_field, send_btn], vertical_alignment=ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER),
```

New:
```
ft.Row([input_field, compact_btn, send_btn], vertical_alignment=ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER),
```

**Result:** `compact_btn` sits immediately left of `send_btn` in the bottom input bar. The button widget itself (defined at lines 226–230) is unchanged.

---

## Part 2 — Guardrail for "Generate Daily Summary"

**File:** `frontend/main.py`

**Location:** `on_daily_summary` function, lines 170–173

Current function body:
```
async def on_daily_summary(e: ft.ControlEvent) -> None:
    await process_chat_message(
        "Please generate a detailed daily summary based on my currently active Jira filters."
    )
```

New function body (guard inserted at the very top, before any network call):
```
async def on_daily_summary(e: ft.ControlEvent) -> None:
    if not app_state.get("filters"):
        show_error_dialog(
            page,
            "Cannot generate summary: No Jira filters configured.\n\n"
            "Remediation: Please open Settings (the gear icon) and import a JQL "
            "string or add a filter before requesting a summary."
        )
        return
    await process_chat_message(
        "Please generate a detailed daily summary based on my currently active Jira filters."
    )
```

**Law compliance (Actionable Observability):** The error dialog provides a specific remediation step. No backend call is made when the guard fires — zero API cost.

**Context Budgeting:** N/A — no Jira API call is made when the guard halts execution. Downstream, the existing `process_chat_message` path already passes only selected filter keys to `/chat`, not raw Jira payloads.

## Part 3 — Append Project Structure to `ARCHITECTURE.md`

**File:** `ARCHITECTURE.md`

A new section will be appended after the existing 5-rule law block. The codebase scan (performed above) identified the following files:

```

### Data Flow Summary

**Flet → FastAPI:** `frontend/main.py` communicates with the backend exclusively over `localhost:8000` HTTP using `httpx`. It never imports backend modules for data access (exception: the in-process uvicorn launch at startup to avoid fork-bombing a packaged `.exe`).

**FastAPI → LangGraph → MCP:** `/chat` passes the user prompt and filter state into the compiled LangGraph graph. The graph's nodes invoke Jira tool calls via MCP (`tools/jira_tool.py`). `jql_parser.py` and the tool layer ensure only extracted fields (`issue_key`, `summary`, `status`, `assignee`) reach the LLM — never raw Jira JSON payloads.

## Part 4 — Jira Settings UX Polish *(retroactively documented — committed in 809cd0a)*

**File:** `frontend/views/jira_settings.py`

### Change 4a — Label shortening
Field labels renamed for visual brevity and to surface the required-field asterisk:
- `"Filter Profile Name"` → `"Profile Name *"`
- `"Jira Personal Access Token"` → `"Jira PAT *"`
- `"Jira Parent Link (required)"` → `"Jira Parent Link *"`

### Change 4b — Field reordering in `_build_dialog_content`
Credential fields (Profile Name, PAT, Parent Link) moved to the **top** of the dialog, before the JQL import card. Previously they appeared below the card, making required fields harder to locate.

### Change 4c — `on_save` validation expanded
Guard widened from checking only `parent_link_field` to checking all three required fields (profile name, PAT, parent link). Missing any one of these produces an actionable error dialog.

### Change 4d — SnackBar → `show_error_dialog`
Replaced inline `page.open(ft.SnackBar(...))` with the shared `show_error_dialog(page, ...)` helper, consistent with the rest of the UI. The dialog provides a specific remediation string (Law: Actionable Observability).
